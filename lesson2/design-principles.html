                <p>In medium.com, it is apparent that when we first enter the site, the sentence: "Write, read, 
                and connect" is the first thing that we read and it feels right; this being placed
                on the "thirds" of the page. It creates that balance in the page and it is more aesthetically
                pleasing to the eye rather than placing it at the center, then it won't look and feel right
                and won't look as balanced.</p>

                <p>When you click on shopify.com, you don't get overwhelmed with information, you know where
                to first look and where to focus on; you can digest information easier. The very first sentence
                we see is "The easiest way to start an online store"; that in itself tells us what shopify.com 
                is all about. Then there is enough white space between that sentence and the prompt to give them
                your email address. In the overall home page of the website, you can see that white space is 
                apparent and it creates balance in the whole page.

                <p>When you enter wistia.com, the contrasting colors between the blue, pink, and white are
                pleasing to the eyes. Our brains tend to notice the differences or contrasts between different
                elements. In this particular webpage, it is the contrast between the colors and the fonts that make us 
                notice the important elements. In this case, the pink buttons with a contrasting white text and a 
                contrasting blue background makes it stand out; and it can be seen that the contrasts are apparent 
                in the whole page.
